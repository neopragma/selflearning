## Topics for Self-Learning

### [Computer Literacy](literacy.html) 

This subject area is intended for people who do not work with computers or software on a technical level, but who want to know more about computers, their history, their impact on society and the world, ethical issues and the implications of artificial intelligence, how to recognize and avoid scams, and how to use a computer on the level of a general user (not a programmer or system administrator).
